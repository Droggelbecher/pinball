Repository with code & electronics documentation for my personal pinball project.

This is far from a complete documentation that by itself woul be sufficient to replicate this project,
nevertheless it might be useful to some.

*boards* contains source code & notes on electronics for the various circuit boards used in the machine.
The main game logic is in the the control module which is basically a Raspberry Pi (plus some level-shifting electronics).
*common_software* contains some bits and pieces of code common to different modules,
mostly around inter-module communication (eg. checksum computation)
